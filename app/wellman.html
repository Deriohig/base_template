                                  Wellman was a project where I worked as full-stack developer. The site was developed from designs provided externally. The designs were incomplete so this meant we needed to fill the gaps ourselves without another design iteration. The client provided the requirements and where there were holes, we filled them.

                    Wellman International is a Wordpress website where I worked as full stack developer alongside a front end and backend developer. Wellmans was externally designed and we were tasked at extracting functionality and deducing reponsive layouts from incomplete designs.
                    <br><br>
                    Wellman, for a change, was a relativly painless implementation on my part. The designs were lacking in functional requirements, but by means of deduction and common sense we fleshed them out. There were a few pieces of JavaScript functionality that I got to implement which I enjoyed the most.
                    <br><br>
                    This project was the last project I was assigned in my time at Software Design as I was only doing support for the remainder of my time.

                      <p class="small-body loan-text">Feedback with the designers was not done until near the end of the project. We had to leave some of the art direction until the end in order to make sure the transitions and hovers were as desired. This streched our thin budget and meant the project went over budget which was unfortunate, however given the time frame of slightly over two weeks we devlivered on time and with quality. </p>

                        Seeing as the contact from the design team was minimal, it was difficult to flesh out some functionality. Parts of the design looked like there was some sort of transition or hover, or effect but it was imposible to tell what it was. We decided to strip out things that we thought didnt make sense and so minimise possible errors.
